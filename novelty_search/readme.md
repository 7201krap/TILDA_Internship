- Implementation of "Efficiently Evolving Programs through the Search for Novelty" with some modification. 

- There are four files that you can run:
1. easy_maze_novelty.py (to run: python easy_maze_novelty.py)
2. easy_maze_original.py (to run: python easy_maze_original.py)
3. hard_maze_novelty.py (to run: python hard_maze_novelty.py)
4. hard_maze_original.py (to run: python hard_maze_original.py)

It is easy to catch the difference between 'novelty' and 'orignal' by running the 3rd and 4th file.
